                <h4>Comfort-Zone...Where?</h4>
                <p> If you feel comfortable with what you are doing, you are not learning anything. You have to push yourelf, push your brain, and push your creative &amp; problem solving mind-set onto a higher level of 'tech'ciousness.</p>

                <p>Don't stay in your comfort-zone out of fear. Make mistakes. Learn how to fix them. Look for the next mistake to fix. This will keep you from making these mistakes later in your career.</p>

                <p>Eventually, not being in your comfort-zone will <strong>BE</strong> your comfort-zone.</p>

                <br>

                <h4>The "ah-ha!" moment <strong>will</strong> come.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>

                <p>Sooner or later (it's different for every body), it will all just <em>click</em>, and everything that looks like <span>strange words with lines running through them</span>, will look like they are highlighted with angelic code light.</p>

                <p>What I mean to say is, it will all make sense if you keep pushing through the confusion, taking in all of the code and letting it soak in until "...no-wait...ohhh yeah I get it now!" happens for you.</p>

                <p>It's a process. And everyone learns at their own pace and in their own ways. Just follow the advice of your instructors and wait for the "ah-ha moments", and you will be oh-so-happy that you did.</p>

                <br>
